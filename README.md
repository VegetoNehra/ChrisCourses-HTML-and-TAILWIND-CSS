# ChrisCourses-HTML-and-TAILWIND-CSS

Welcome to my personal website, created as part of my learning journey in web development. This website is built using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**, following a tutorial, and serves as a showcase of my progress as I continue to grow as a developer.

## About Me

I'm an **amateur coder** on a path to explore the world of **technology** and **programming**. So far, I've gained foundational knowledge in:

- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**
- **C++**
- **Python**
- **HTML & CSS**
- **Tailwind CSS**

I’m currently working on improving my skills and diving deeper into **web development**, **AI**, and **machine learning**. This website represents my first steps in **front-end development**, and I am excited to keep learning and building more complex projects.

## What’s Inside

- **Responsive Website**: Built using **HTML** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Mobile-First Design**: The website adapts to both mobile and desktop views.
- **Basic Layout**: Includes a header, video section, and call-to-action buttons.

## Goals for This Project

This project is a stepping stone in my web development journey. By building this website, I aimed to:

1. Understand **HTML** structure and best practices.
2. Learn and implement **Tailwind CSS** for fast and responsive design.
3. Build a **simple but professional website** to display my work and passion for coding.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content and layout of the website.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive designs quickly and efficiently.
- **Video Background**: A dynamic background to add some flair to the page.

## Future Plans

I plan to keep improving this website by adding more interactive features and sections. I also aim to:

- Integrate **JavaScript** for more dynamic functionality.
- Experiment with **React.js** or **Vue.js** for better state management and UI interactions.
- Continuously learn more about **front-end** and **back-end** technologies.
- Explore the potential of **AI** and **machine learning** in web development.
